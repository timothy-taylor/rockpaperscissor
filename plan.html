        1. The computer makes a selection (random)
        <br>2. The user makes a selection (made case insensitive)
        <br>3. A single round is played using the player selection and computer selection and a result is returned
        <br>4. The game is finished (5 rounds total), the result of each round is returned
        <br>5. A full recap occurs in the console log
